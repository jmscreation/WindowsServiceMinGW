# Create A Windows Service Using MinGW


This project demonstrates compiling a windows service using MinGW with the CodeBlocks IDE.

This uses MinGW 7.3.0, with the -m64 compile flag.
I personally prefer to compile 64bit applications as this is what all future operating systems will eventually be required to run; however, this project should (this has not yet been tested) still compile for 32bit operating systems.
